# Hello, I'm [Carlton Upperdine](https://linkedin.com/in/carltonupp)!

### About me

I'm a Software Engineer from the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and I currently work at [BJSS](https://www.bjss.com/).

Throughout my career I have worn many hats, having worked in technical capabilities such as Software Engineering, QA, SRE/DevOps, Agile Delivery and more recently as a Consultant.

I started out my career in the .NET/Microsoft space, but in recent years I have had the opportunity to work in a more tech agnostic way and have gained experience with languages such as Java, TypeScript and Go.
